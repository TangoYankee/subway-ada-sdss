<description>This line layer represents MTA New York City Transit local bus routes. Each line represents an individual bus route over a roadway for a specific direction. The unique ID for the features is route_id, which is a combination of the bus route ID and its direction; routes with a 0 run either northbound or eastbound, while routes with a 1 run southbound or westbound. This layer was created by the GIS Lab at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layer series, to provide access to mass transit features for basic geographic analysis and map making. The data was generated from the MTA's static data developer feeds. It was transformed and generalized from a GTFS format into readily usable GIS features using a series of python scripts.</description>
