<description>This point layer represents MTA New York City Transit express bus stops. Express buses are long-distance coaches that take passengers from areas of the outer boroughs to midtown and downtown Manhattan and back, with limited stops. For Manhattan-bound buses, riders can only board the bus at the outer borough stops (no one may disembark) and can only disembark at Manhattan stops (no one may board). The inverse is true for outer borough-bound buses. The mid-section of each route is express, and no stops are made. Each point represents an individual location where one or more buses make stops along one or more bus routes.  The unique ID for the features is stop_id, a field created by the MTA. The geoid field indicates which county the stop is located in using the state-county ANSI FIPS code. This layer was created by the GIS Lab at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layer series, to provide access to mass transit features for basic geographic analysis and map making. The data was generated from the MTA's static data developer feeds. It was transformed and generalized from a GTFS format into readily usable GIS features using a series of python scripts.</description>
