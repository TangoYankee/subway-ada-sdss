NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layers
Notes for the Nov 2020 Edition

Data for the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layers series is generated from the static data developer feeds published by the MTA. The layers released for the Nov 2020 edition of our series represent normal service that resumed following the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. Compared to the previous edition that we published in May 2020, all subway and most bus services were restored to their pre-pandemic state.

We did not publish updates for the Metro North or LIRR for this edition, because there had been no changes in the underlying source data. These services were not affected by the pandemic, in that no routes or stops were modified or eliminated.
